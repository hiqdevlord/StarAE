Introduction
----
This repo, Star-AE, with this geeky name expressed as regex style, would implement all kinds of Autoencoders for research uses. Autoencoder, a Neural Nets alike model, is often used for some unsupervised learning purposes. Advocated by open-source spirit and hot trend of Deep Learning recently, this repo is started. Any pull request is welcome!

Lots of the off-the-shell tools for Deep Learning, such as Torch and Theano, provide abundant (maybe not :) ) APIs for users. Definitelly, they did such a good job on helping people set up Deep Learning and drive Neural Nets much more easily. Nevertheless, these tool won't make improvement for researchers because what researcher needs always differs from engineers. Researches care more about the structure of Neural Nets or the algorithms of optimizing; thus, they can hardly be content with the dead APIs given. This is the reason why I build this repo - You can use it, modify it, improve it, add more modules to it and do anything you want. Hope you like it!
