***  mini-batch BFGS + mini-batch CG
??? Mini-batch BFGS doesn't make sense! If in each inner-loop, it updates only one iterate, then how does the pseudo Hessian update? With only 1 iterate, pseudo Hessian not updated, then BFGS's value is vanished. See some paper..

logger has to be involved in ae.py... This makes me very uncomfortable

compute_cost add a flag... uuuuuuugly.
