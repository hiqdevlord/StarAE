 *** Normalization?

***  mini-batch BFGS + mini-batch CG
??? Mini-batch BFGS doesn't make sense! If in each inner-loop, it updates only one iterate, then how does the pseudo Hessian update? With only 1 iterate, pseudo Hessian not updated, then BFGS's value is vanished. See some paper..

logger has to be involved in ae.py... This makes me very uncomfortable

After talking to Wan:
1. Sixin Zhang and Xiang Zhang, Ross
2. Done. Visualizition improve
3. Done. BFGS works. Go on testing your SparseAe, to make it work rightly
4. Normalization right? Or rescale? Or standardize? See FAQ of NN
